# How does it work?
1. Hidden installation of Python and necessary modules.
2. Creation of a hidden Python script '.keylogger.py'. By default in /tmp.
3. Creation of a hidden text file '.log.txt'. By default in /tmp.
4. Launching the '.keylogger.py' script. The script records all keystrokes typed by the user and saves them in the text file.
